    <H2>THE RUN-MACHINE</H2>
    <H3>BASIC INFORMATION</H3>
    <P>&#9733;Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, rated as one of the best batsmen across all the cricket formats. Considered as a fierce competitor, he occasionally performs as a right-arm medium pace bowler. He is known for his dependable and powerful batting style and has single-handedly won several matches for India. Virat became fascinated with cricket quite early on in his life and took to the bat when he was just three. His parents recognized his potential and had him enrolled at the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was nine years old. He developed into a very talented player over the ensuing years and represented his city Delhi at various age-group levels and domestic cricket. His first major success came in 2008 when he captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Soon he was selected to play for the Indian team and established himself as a valuable number 3 batsman. After having gained a reputation as an “ODI specialist”, he proved his mettle in test cricket and T20 cricket as well. Currently, he is the captain of the Indian team in all the 3 formats of the game.</P>
<H4>CAREER</H4>
<P>&#9733;In 2002, he played for Delhi Under-15 team and became the leading run-getter in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy tournament. He was made the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy.
    <BR>&#9733;He was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds. He repeated his fabulous performance the next season too, and helped Delhi lift the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;His consistent performances earned him a place in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England in 2006. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series which the India Under-19 squad won. He also performed remarkably against Pakistan’s U-19 cricket team later that year.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;His father died in 2006 when Kohli was just 18. His father had been his biggest support and his untimely death plunged the family into a financial crisis. With more responsibilities on his young shoulders now, Kohli began taking the game even more seriously.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;He was selected for the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka in 2008. During the tour, he batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series as both the regular openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured. India eventually won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;He continued with his good form which earned him a place in the 2011 World Cup squad. Kohli played in every match in the tournament and scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh, becoming the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. India reached the finals, and Kohli scored important 35 runs in the finals against Sri Lanka. India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. In the final group stage match against Pakistan he scored 183 whilst chasing—the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs—and broke West Indies’ Brian Lara’s long standing record of 156. Despite his great performances India could not progress to the final of the tournament.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;His string of successful stints continued throughout 2013. He played well in the seven-match ODI series against Australia, striking the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur by blasting a 100 off just 52 balls. His innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360. Even though better known for his blazing performances in ODIs, Kohli is also a skilled test player. In 2014, he was named the captain of the Indian test squad. In the Australian tour the same year, he amassed a total of 692 runs in four Tests—the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;Kohli has been in terrific form in 2016. His superlative batting performances helped India reach the semifinals of 2016 T20 World Cup, held in India.</BR>
    <BR>&#9733;Kohli made a resurgence of his form during the Asia Cup 2022, Over the course of the tournament, he amassed a total of 276 runs with an average of 92, The highlight of his performance was his maiden T20I century against Afghanistan, a knock that saw him score 122 runs from 61 deliveries, it was his first century in 1020 days.[296] He later said in post match presentation that:

        "Last two and a half years have taught me a lot. I am going to turn 34 in a month. So those angry celebrations are a thing of the past . I have had many suggestions, lot of advice has come my way; people were telling me I was doing this wrong, that wrong, I picked out all the videos from the best time I had; same initial movement, same approach towards the ball and it was just what was happening inside my head I wasn't able to explain it to anyone "
        
        — Kohli after scoring 71st century,</BR>
        <BR>&#9733;He carried his good form into the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In the first game against Pakistan, Kohli scored 82* and won the match for his team by a close margin. He rated this as his best innings in the format due to the magnitude which the game had. Wisden, the prestigious almanack of cricket, has deemed this particular innings as the acme of the tournament. Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer in the tournament, with 296 runs to his name at an average of 98.66. For his performances, he was included in Team of the tournament</BR>
            <BR>&#9733;Kohli was named in India's Test and ODI squad for India Tour of Bangladesh in 2022–23. In third-match, he scored his 44th ODI and overall 72nd century surpassing Ricky Ponting's record of the second-most centuries scored across formats in international cricket</BR>
            <BR>&#9733;In the early part of the year, Kohli began his campaign with a century against the touring Sri Lankan side in ODI.[303] In the third match of the series, Kohli delivered a prodigious performance, amassing an unbeaten 166 runs from 110 balls. This century, his 21st in India, marked a milestone as he surpassed all other players for the most ODI centuries scored in the country. Additionally, his performance in this match elevated him to become the fifth highest run-scorer in ODI cricket, going ahead of Mahela Jayawardene.Following Kohli's performance, India went on to win the third ODI match by a record margin of 317 runs. In February–March 2023, Kohli played in the Border-Gavaskar series of 2023. He faced a string of low scores in the initial three tests, before playing an innings of discipline and technical correctness, in the final test at Ahmedabad. He amassed a total of 186 runs in the match with his century being his first in the format in three years. </BR>
